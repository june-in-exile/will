# Web3 Will System

A blockchain-based inheritance management framework that leverages Permit2, CREATE2, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and IPFS to securely handle the creation, notarization, and execution of on-chain wills.

## System Overview

The system follows a multi-role collaboration model involving four key participants: Testator, Executor, Notary, and Oracle. Each role operates within a distinct stage of the process‚Äîcreation, notarization, activation, and execution‚Äîensuring that every step of the digital will lifecycle is verifiable, secure, and privacy-preserving.

By combining decentralized storage (IPFS), verifiable computation (ZKPs), programmable inheritance logic (smart contracts with CREATE2), and trustless authorization (Permit2), the system provides a transparent yet confidential method to manage digital wills and asset transfers on the blockchain.

### 1. Will Creation (Testator)

The Testator begins by approving the maximum token allowance to the Permit2 contract, preparing for future authorized asset transfers. Through the system interface, the Testator inputs the will content, after which the system performs the following steps:

- Generates a Permit2 signature to authorize future token transfers
- Serializes and encrypts the will, producing an **Encrypted Will**
- Locally generates a **CID Upload Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** to prove the validity and structure of the uploaded content without revealing the plaintext
- Uploads the encrypted will to IPFS, obtains the corresponding Content Identifier (CID), and submits both the CID and ZKP to the `uploadCid` function of `WillFactory.sol`

### 2. Notarization (Notary)

Once the will is uploaded, the Notary calls the `notarizeCid` function in `WillFactory.sol` to notarize the corresponding CID. This ensures that the encrypted will has been verified and witnessed by a trusted party, establishing legal validity and preventing unauthorized uploads.

### 3. Activation (Oracle)

Before the Testator's death, the encrypted will remains inaccessible and cannot be instantiated or executed. When the Oracle receives verifiable death confirmation data from an authoritative source (such as a government registry or medical attestation), it calls `WillFactory.sol` (e.g., `authorizeExecution`) to confirm that the Testator has passed away. This authorization enables the Executor to proceed with will creation and execution, ensuring that the process only begins under legitimate conditions.

### 4. Will Creation and Execution (Executor)

After receiving authorization from the Oracle, the Executor retrieves the Encrypted Will from IPFS using the stored CID. With access to the decryption key (provided by the Testator; key transmission and custody details are outside the system's scope), the Executor decrypts and deserializes the will. The Executor then:

- Generates a **Will Creation ZKP**, proving that the decrypted content matches the previously uploaded version and adheres to the required format
- Calls the `createWill` function in `WillFactory.sol` to deploy a verified `Will.sol` contract instance on-chain
- Executes the `signatureTransferToBeneficiaries` function in `Will.sol`, which internally calls the Permit2 contract to automatically and securely transfer the Testator's assets to the designated beneficiaries according to the signed authorization

```

3. **Start development environment**

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev

# Or start separately
pnpm dev:frontend  # http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev:backend   # http://localhost:3001
```

## üìù Available Commands

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development mode
pnpm dev                  # Start both frontend and backend

## üîß Project Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the fields required to interact with the contracts:

```bash
ARB_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://arb-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
ARBSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ARBSCAN_API_KEY

EXECUTOR=0x_YOUR_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS
